## How to enable it

One of the goals of GQty is to embrace the React features [Suspense](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html) & [Concurrent Mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html).

Until these features become widespread enough, you will need to **opt-in** for Suspense support via configuration. This can be done directly in hook, or via the [defaults of the client](/docs/react/config#defaults).

```ts
// Enabling support with hooks
const query = useQuery({ suspense: true });

// Enabling support with HoC
const Component = graphql(() => <div />, { suspense: true });
```

## Usage without Suspense

All hooks return a `$state` object, when suspense support is not enabled.

```tsx
function Example() {
  const query = useQuery({ suspense: false });

  if (query.$state.isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>;

  return <p>{helloWorld}</p>;
}
```

## Suspense & SSR

React doesn't yet support suspense whilst rendering on the server, so [react-ssr-prepass](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-ssr-prepass) is used in our SSR functions:

And for that, reason we suggest using a slighty modified `Suspense` component:

```tsx
import { Suspense as ReactSuspense, SuspenseProps } from 'react';

export const Suspense =
  typeof window !== 'undefined'
    ? ReactSuspense
    : function SuspenseSSR({ children }: SuspenseProps) {
        return <>{children}</>;
      };
```

And everything should work as you might expect.
