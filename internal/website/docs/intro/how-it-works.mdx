GQty performs an invisible render (called the skeleton render) of all components, to identify the data they need. During this render, all scalars & enums are returned as `undefined` (aka. skeleton values).
Once the response from the server arrives, these skeleton values are replaced with actual ones.

## Will it affect bundle size?

In the code-generated files, an object representation of the schema is outputted - negligible for most apps. This could be optimized in the future by stripping out unused parts.

The gqty packages are lightweight and don't require external dependencies.

## How fast is it?

Very fast, gqty's architecture was designed with performance in mind. Unlike other clients, queries are generated directly - instead of outputting intermediate AST.
